## Next PR to Work On

### START HERE: PR1 — Outline Review

**Quick Summary**:
Produce the complete book outline: README.md with TOC, all 14 chapter files (00-preface + 01 through 13) as outlines only (section headings + bullet points, no prose), WORKS_CITED.md skeleton, DIAGRAM_INVENTORY.md, and CHAPTER_ASSIGNMENTS.md. Submit for Steve's review before any authoring begins.

**Pre-flight Checklist**:
- [x] Research completed (8 topics, synthesized in research/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md)
- [x] Ebook scaffolded (ebooks/ml-inference-apis/ exists with README.md)
- [x] PROPOSAL.md copied into ebook directory
- [ ] Review research findings before starting outlines

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] README.md with full TOC and book metadata
- [ ] chapters/00-preface.md (outline)
- [ ] chapters/01-the-serving-problem.md through chapters/13-putting-it-all-together.md (outlines)
- [ ] WORKS_CITED.md skeleton
- [ ] DIAGRAM_INVENTORY.md
- [ ] edits/CHAPTER_ASSIGNMENTS.md
- [ ] `just validate ml-inference-apis` passes

## Update Protocol

After completing each PR:
1. Update the PR status to 🟢 Complete
2. Fill in completion percentage
3. Update chapter progress matrix
4. Add any notes (commit hash, blockers, changes)
5. Update the "Next PR to Work On" section
6. Update overall progress percentage and bar
7. Commit changes to this document

## Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- This is a **companion book** to "Before the 3 AM Alert" — cross-references are important
- **Serving, not training** — this scope boundary is non-negotiable
- **Audio/speech as running example** — every chapter should connect back to this use case
- Research notes are in `research/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` — consult before writing any chapter
- Follow conventions from `ebooks/api-optimization/` exactly (see AGENTS.md)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't write full prose during the outline PR — outlines only (headings + bullet points)
- Don't skip the research review before writing — findings shape the content
- Don't forget cross-references to Book 1 in every chapter where applicable
- Don't submit chapters without `just validate ml-inference-apis` passing

### Resources
- Book proposal: `ebooks/ml-inference-apis/PROPOSAL.md`
- Book 1 for conventions: `ebooks/api-optimization/`
- Research: `.roadmap/in-progress/ml-inference-apis/research/`
- Style guide: `.ai/docs/style-guide.md`
- Diagram template: `.ai/templates/html-diagram.html`

## Definition of Done

The ebook is considered complete when:
- [ ] All 14 chapter files have full prose (not just outlines)
- [ ] All diagrams created and referenced
- [ ] WORKS_CITED.md fully populated with verified sources
- [ ] `just validate ml-inference-apis` passes
- [ ] `just lint md ml-inference-apis` passes
- [ ] All output formats build successfully (`just build-all ml-inference-apis`)
- [ ] Steve has reviewed and approved all chapters
