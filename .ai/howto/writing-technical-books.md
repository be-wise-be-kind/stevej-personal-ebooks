# How to Write a Technical Book

Best practices for authoring technical books, summarized from industry sources.

## Introduction Best Practices

### Focus on "Why," Not "What"
An introduction should give readers the motivation for why the book was written. Provide context, state your purpose, and define the scope. Save technical details for later chapters.

### Avoid Unnecessary Background
Many technical books open with "a short introduction to XYZ," but these are rarely useful. If your audience already knows the basics, they don't need it. If they don't, a brief intro won't help. Be honest about your target audience.

### Hook-Oriented Openings
The introduction is the most important part for attracting readers. Clearly state purpose and relevance in a way that hooks the reader, then briefly outline the chapter structure.

## Audience and Structure

### Define Your Audience
Start with learner personas describing:
- Who you are teaching
- What they already know
- What they want to learn

This clarity shapes every decision about content depth and assumed knowledge.

### Build Knowledge Stepwise
Each chapter should cover a single concept, arranged in a sequence that builds knowledge step-by-step. Readers should be able to apply what they learn at each stage.

### Structure for Technical Books
A proven pattern for technical content:
1. Fundamentals and core concepts first
2. Architectural patterns and design principles
3. Practical application and implementation
4. Deployment, configuration, and advanced topics

## Writing Style

### Use Direct Address
- Write in imperative, direct address style
- Use "you" when addressing readers
- Prefer active voice over passive
- Keep text short but descriptive
- Avoid jargon; when technical terms are necessary, define them

### Code Examples
- All code examples are placed in the Code Examples appendix
- No inline fenced code blocks in chapter text
- Reference examples by number: "(see Example N.M)"
- Keep prose descriptions of concepts separate from implementation details

### Appendix Placement
All code examples are collected in a dedicated Code Examples appendix. This keeps chapters focused on concepts while providing complete, runnable implementations in one reference location.

- Reference examples as "Example N.M" where N is chapter number
- Each example includes language, descriptive title, and context
- Examples should be 15-40 lines, focused on one pattern
